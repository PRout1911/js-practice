const abc = 1
let name1 = "abs"
var mail = "abc@maiil.com" /* Don't use VAR to declare varaibles as js have some issues with block and functional scope*/
let xyz; // js will name it as undefined
console.log(name1); // use to print a single output
console.table([name1, mail]); // use to print multiple output in a tabular form
xyz = '123' //this is not a good practice
